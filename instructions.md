## React to a post or comment

To like or dislike a post or comment you must be logged in. Use the ID of the
target post or comment along with the reaction type:

```
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/forum/api/react \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"target_id":"<TARGET_ID>","target_type":"post","reaction_type":1}' \
  -b cookies.txt

curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/forum/api/react \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"target_id":"<TARGET_ID>","target_type":"comment","reaction_type":2}' \
  -b cookies.txt
```
Reaction type `1` represents a like and `2` represents a dislike. Running the
command again with the same parameters will toggle the reaction off.
