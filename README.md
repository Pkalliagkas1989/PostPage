This repository contains a Go backend API and a simple static user interface served via the `ui` module.

The JavaScript-based frontend has been removed to simplify the project. The HTML templates now submit forms directly to the API endpoints.

Run the API and UI servers with Docker Compose:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```
